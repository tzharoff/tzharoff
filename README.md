- 👋 Hi, I’m @tzharoff
- 👀 I’m interested in game development using Unity. Starting a fun little business with my kids to make game ideas they have. We're not charging anything, using it more as a learning experience, so we'll be posting our games on the iOS app store and the source up here.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to enjoy life more!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that's geared towards learning/teaching.
- 📫 How to reach me: @zeej_the_insane on twitter
